# holbertonschool-AirBnB_clone
AirBNB clone project at Holberton
Right now, we're focusing on the console.
## Directions
Starting program:
    For Windows:
        ```python console.py```
    For Linux:
        ```python3 console.py```
        or
        ```./console.py```
        (The execute permission should already be present, but in the weird case that it isn't, use: ```chmod u+x console.py```)

Getting help for commands:
    ```(bhnb) help <command you want help in>```
    for example:
    ```
    (hbnb) help quit
    Quit command to exit the program

    (hbnb) 
    ```

Ending program:
    ```
    (bhnb) <Ctrl + D>
    holbertonschool-AirBnB_clone$ 
    ```
    or
    ```
    (hbnb) quit
    holbertonschool-AirBnB_clone$ 
    ```
